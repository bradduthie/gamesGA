gamesGA: 
================================================================================

********************************************************************************

> **The [gameGA](https://github.com/bradduthie/gamesGA) R package simulates a genetic algorithm for finding adaptive strategies in sequentially played rounds of any two by two sequential payoff matrix game iterated between players. Below, the embedded [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application recognises user inputs in the `games_ga()` function and returns a table showing surviving strategies and their corresponding frequencies.**
